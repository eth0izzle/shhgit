# **shhgit**: find GitHub secrets in real time

**Shhgit finds secrets and sensitive files across GitHub code and Gists committed in *near* real time by listening to the [GitHub Events API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/).**

## **[NEW: LIVE VERSION. Find GitHub secrets straight from your browser!](https://shhgit.darkport.co.uk)**

Finding secrets in GitHub is nothing new. There are many great tools available to help with this depending on which side of the fence you sit. On the adversarial side, popular tools such as <a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob">gitrob</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog">truggleHog</a> focus on digging in to commit history to find secret tokens from specific repositories, users or organisations. On the defensive side, GitHub themselves are actively scanning for secrets through their [token scanning](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-token-scanning) project. Their objective is to identify secret tokens within committed code in real-time and notify the service provider to action. So in theory if any AWS secret keys are committed to GitHub, Amazon will be notified and automatically revoke them.

I developed shhgit to raise awareness and bring to life the prevalence of this issue. I hope GitHub will do more to prevent bad actors using the treasure trove of information across the platform. I don't know the inner-workings of their [token scanning](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-token-scanning) project but delaying the real-time feed API until the pipeline has completed and posing SLAs on the providers seems like a step in the right direction.

**With some tweaking of the signatures shhgit would make an awesome addition to your bug bounty toolkit.**

## Installation

You can use the [precompiled binaries](https://www.github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit/releases) **or** build from source:

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) for your platform.
2. `$ go get github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit` will download and build shhgit.
3. See usage.

## Usage

shhgit needs to access the public GitHub API so you will need to obtain and provide an access token. The API has a hard rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour per account, regardless what token is used. The more account-unique tokens you provide, the faster you can process the events. Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to generate a token; it doesn't require any scopes or permissions. And then place it under `github_access_tokens` in `config.yaml`. **Note that it is against the GitHub terms to bypass their rate limits. Use multiple tokens at your own risk**.

Unlike other tools, you don't need to pass any targets with shhgit. Simply run `$ shhgit` to start watching GitHub commits and find secrets or sensitive files matching the included 120 signatures.

Alternatively, you can forgo the signatures and use shhgit with a search query, e.g. to find all AWS keys you could use `shhgit --search-query AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA`

### Options

```
--clone-repository-timeout
        Maximum time it should take to clone a repository in seconds (default 10)
--csv-path
        Specify a path if you want to write found secrets to a CSV. Leave blank to disable
--debug
        Print debugging information
--entropy-threshold
        Finds high entropy strings in files. Higher threshold = more secret secrets, lower threshold = more false positives. Set to 0 to disable entropy checks (default 5.0)
--maximum-file-size
        Maximum file size to process in KB (default 512)
--maximum-repository-size
        Maximum repository size to download and process in KB) (default 5120)
--minimum-stars
        Only clone repositories with this many stars or higher. Set to 0 to ignore star count (default 0)
--path-checks
        Set to false to disable file name/path signature checking, i.e. just match regex patterns (default true)
--process-gists
        Watch and process Gists in real time. Set to false to disable (default true)
--search-query
        Specify a search string to ignore signatures and filter on files containing this string (regex compatible)
--silent
        Suppress all output except for errors
--temp-directory
        Directory to store repositories/matches (default "%temp%\shhgit")
--threads
        Number of concurrent threads to use (default number of logical CPUs)
```

### Config

The `config.yaml` file has 6 elements. A [default is provided](https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit/blob/master/config.yaml).

```
github_access_tokens: # provide at least one token
  - 'token one'
  - 'token two'
slack_webhook: '' # url to your slack webhook. Found secrets will be sent here
blacklisted_extensions: [] # list of extensions to ignore
blacklisted_paths: [] # list of paths to ignore
blacklisted_entropy_extensions: [] # additional extensions to ignore for entropy checks
signatures: # list of signatures to check
  - part: '' # either filename, extension, path or contents
    match: '' # simple text comparison (if no regex element)
    regex: '' # regex pattern (if no match element)
    name: '' # name of the signature
```

#### Signatures

shhgit comes with 120 signatures. You can remove or add more by editing `config.yaml`.
