## **shhgit finds committed secrets and sensitive files across GitHub, Gists, GitLab and BitBucket or your local repositories in real time.**

Finding secrets in GitHub is nothing new. There are many great tools available to help with this depending on which side of the fence you sit. On the adversarial side, popular tools such as <a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob">gitrob</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog">truggleHog</a> focus on digging in to commit history to find secret tokens from specific repositories, users or organisations. On the defensive side, GitHub themselves are actively scanning for secrets through their [token scanning](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-token-scanning) project. Their objective is to identify secret tokens within committed code in real-time and notify the service provider to action. So in theory if any AWS secret keys are committed to GitHub, Amazon will be notified and automatically revoke them.

I developed shhgit to raise awareness and bring to life the prevalence of this issue. I hope GitHub will do more to prevent bad actors using the treasure trove of information across the platform. I don't know the inner-workings of their [token scanning](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-token-scanning) project but delaying the real-time feed API until the pipeline has completed and posing SLAs on the providers seems like a step in the right direction.

## Installation

You have two options. I'd recommend the first as it will give you access to the [shhgit web interface](https://shhgit.darkport.co.uk/). Use the second option if you just want the command line interface.

### via Docker

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit.git`
2. Build via Docker compose: `docker-compose build`
3. Edit your `config.yaml` file (i.e. adding your GitHub tokens)
4. Bring up the stack: `docker-compose up`
5. Open up http://localhost:8080/


### via Go get

_Note_: this method does not include the shhgit web interface

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) for your platform.
2. `go get github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit` will download and build shhgit automatically. Or you can clone this repository and run `go build -v -i`.
3. Edit your `config.yaml` file and see usage below.

## Usage

shhgit can work in two ways: consuming the public APIs of GitHub, Gist, GitLab and BitBucket  or by processing files in a local directory.

By default, shhgit will run in the former 'public mode'. For GitHub and Gist, you will need to obtain and provide an access token (see [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line); it doesn't require any scopes or permissions. And then place it under `github_access_tokens` in `config.yaml`).
For GitHub Enterprise (GHE) a token is also needed, but rate limiting is configurable and your token might need read access to the repositories in questions depending on the configuration of your GHE instance. GitLab and BitBucket do not require any API tokens.

You can also forgo the signatures and use shhgit with your own custom search query, e.g. to find all AWS keys you could use `shhgit --search-query AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA`. And to run in local mode (and perhaps integrate in to your CI pipelines) you can pass the `--local` flag (see usage below).

### Options

```
--clone-repository-timeout
        Maximum time it should take to clone a repository in seconds (default 10)
--config-path
        Searches for config.yaml from given directory. If not set, tries to find if from shhgit binary's and current directory
--csv-path
        Specify a path if you want to write found secrets to a CSV. Leave blank to disable
--debug
        Print debugging information
--entropy-threshold
        Finds high entropy strings in files. Higher threshold = more secret secrets, lower threshold = more false positives. Set to 0 to disable entropy checks (default 5.0)
--local
        Specify local directory (absolute path) which to scan. Scans only given directory recursively. No need to have Github tokens with local run.
--maximum-file-size
        Maximum file size to process in KB (default 512)
--maximum-repository-size
        Maximum repository size to download and process in KB) (default 5120)
--minimum-stars
        Only clone repositories with this many stars or higher. Set to 0 to ignore star count (default 0)
--path-checks
        Set to false to disable file name/path signature checking, i.e. just match regex patterns (default true)
--process-gists
        Watch and process Gists in real time. Set to false to disable (default true)
--search-query
        Specify a search string to ignore signatures and filter on files containing this string (regex compatible)
--silent
        Suppress all output except for errors
--temp-directory
        Directory to store repositories/matches (default "%temp%\shhgit")
--threads
        Number of concurrent threads to use (default number of logical CPUs)
```

### Config

The `config.yaml` file has 7 elements. A [default is provided](https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit/blob/master/config.yaml).

```
github_access_tokens: # provide at least one token
  - 'token one'
  - 'token two'
github_enterprise_url: '' # url to your github enterprise (optional)
webhook: '' # URL to a POST webhook.
webhook_payload: '' # Payload to POST to the webhook URL
blacklisted_strings: [] # list of strings to ignore
blacklisted_extensions: [] # list of extensions to ignore
blacklisted_paths: [] # list of paths to ignore
blacklisted_entropy_extensions: [] # additional extensions to ignore for entropy checks
signatures: # list of signatures to check
  - part: '' # either filename, extension, path or contents
    match: '' # simple text comparison (if no regex element)
    regex: '' # regex pattern (if no match element)
    name: '' # name of the signature
```

#### Signatures

shhgit comes with 150 signatures. You can remove or add more by editing the `config.yaml` file.
